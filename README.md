# Football Quiz

This website can offer an interactive quiz game for football fans. You will have a limited time to answer all football questions and every wrong answer will be punished with a red card. If you get a high score then you'll be awarded the best football fans joke I've ever heard.
It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for all users.

## Features

The features in this game are the countdown time limit of 90 seconds for 11 questions, which is shown all the time at the bottom of the play area, and the 10 seconds penalty for wrong questions. When the quiz is over, the screen will display the result with some quotes depending on the score reached and the home button for those who want to try it again.

### Existing Features

- __Start section__

  - This section shows the users the rules of the quiz game and a "Kick-Off" button to allow them to start the quiz.
  - It is fully responsive and has the same layout as the play area, as well as the result section.

### Features Left to Implement
- I would like to randomize the questions and the answers as well.
- Add more questions from different categories of football.
- Implement some animations in the result section.

  ## _**Design**_
  * ### _Colors:_

    * The quiz box is the same in all sections and has a background-color of orange (rgba(228, 127, 64, 0.9)) with 90% opacity.
    * The questions are written in white color and the answers are written in deeper orange color (rgb(151, 62, 6)) on a white background to have the best visibility.
    * I choose these colors because I am a big fan of holland football and these are the color of the national Holland football team.
  * ### _Font:_
    * I would like to keep it simple here with just an Open Serif font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open).
